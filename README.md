## Requirements

- It's required to define code owners in a `CODEOWNERS` file. By default this extension looks for `CODEOWNERS` file in the  `.github/` folder. 

## Extension Settings

If you store your `CODEOWNERS` file in a folder different than `.github/` you can add it in extension configurations using `extension.codeOwnersPath`.
